## Project Overview: Game Arcade Website

### Games Included:
- **Connect4:** Implemented from scratch, fully functional with dedicated CSS, JS, and HTML files.
- **2048:** Implemented from scratch, works as expected with separate files for CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
- **Minesweeper:** Adapted from an existing repository ([Minesweeper by Park Junha](https://github.com/park-junha/Minesweeper)). Original implementation had UI limitations such as placement at the top left corner and clashing color schemes.

### Minesweeper Enhancements:
- **UI Adjustments:** We centralized the game grid to enhance visual appeal and integrated it seamlessly into the websiteâ€™s theme. We also adjusted the color palette to avoid clashes and improve the overall aesthetics.
- **Flag System:** We modified the flagging mechanic for marking mines. Originally requiring a right-click to place a flag, it now now requires clicking a dedicated flag icon. This adjustment aligns better with user experience.
- **Game Dynamics:** Some of the enhancements include an immediate game reset and new game initiation upon changing difficulty levels. This feature streamlines the user experience by eliminating manual refresh or navigation steps.
- **Visual Feedback:** Additionally, we introduced additional images and color variations to represent different numbers of adjacent mines, enhancing the visual feedback and user interaction with the game.

These changes were targeted mainly at improving the user interface and interaction, making Minesweeper more engaging and consistent with the overall design of the arcade site.
